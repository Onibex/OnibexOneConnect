# Endpoint Customization (SM59)

SAP uses the **Remote Function Call (RFC)** to establish connections with external systems. This RFC serves as an exclusive interface for communication between SAP systems and external applications, enabling SAP to function as both a client and a server in familiar RFC scenarios.

To customize this asset in SAP, it is crucial to know the parameters governing the web connection to which SAP will be linked. Essential details such as the **URL**, **port**, and **RFC type** are required for its successful integration.

> 📋 **Prerequisites:** Before starting, make sure you have the host, port, path prefix, and credentials of the destination created beforehand in the Smart Gateway.

## Step 2: Locate HTTP Connections

Expand the **HTTP Connections to External Server** node.

- If you **already have an RFC** created, select it and skip to **Step 5** to make any necessary changes.
- If you **need to create one**, continue with the next step.

## Step 4: Define the Connection Name

Fill in the following values:

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| **Connection Type** | **G — HTTP Connection to External Server** |
| **Destination Name** *(recommended)* | `ONIBEX_ONECONNECT` or `ONIBEX_POC` |

## Step 5: Configure Technical Settings

Fill in the following values on the **Technical Settings** tab:

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| **Descriptions** *(optional)* | `Onibex One Connect` |
| **Host** | IP address of the server where data is sent from SAP. |
| **Port** | Port number used to connect with the host. |
| **Path Prefix** | The path where the web/app is located. |

> 💡 **Example: How to split a URL**
>
> Full URL: `https://{DOMAIN}:5051/api/v1/saplistener/{CLIENT}`
>
> - **Host:** `{DOMAIN}`
> - **Port:** `5051`
> - **Path Prefix:** `/api/v1/saplistener/{CLIENT}`

## Step 6: Configure Logon & Security

In the **Logon & Security** tab, enter the username and password that you previously set up on the **OneConnect** site.

> ℹ️ These credentials must match the user account configured in the Smart Gateway for the corresponding workspace.

### Interpreting the HTTP Response Status

| Status Code | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| **200** | ✅ Successful connection. | No action needed. |
| **400** | ⚠️ Server not detected. | Review host, port, and path prefix. |
| **500** | ❌ Authentication failure. | Review username and password in Logon & Security. |
